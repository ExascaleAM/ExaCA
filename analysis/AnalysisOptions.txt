**********
Representative volume elements: lines have the format [size, center x, center y, center z, .ang print, .csv print]
Multiple RVEs can be printed as long as they are formatted as above and on separate lines
size of the RVE domain is given in cells (if > the domain size, size will be adjusted automatically)
center x, center y, and center z are the location (in cells) of the center of this RVE (If "D" is given as any of the inputs, the RVE will be taken to be as close to the domain center in x and y as possible, and as close to the top of the domain in z as possible while avoiding the last layer's microstructure)
.ang print and .csv print are Y/N options, whether or not to print an orientation file readable by pyEBSD to plot pole figures, and whether or not to print a file formatted for ExaConstit analysis of the microstructure
*****
[D, D, D, 200, Y, N]
**********
Cross-sections for .ang files: lines have the format [plane, out of plane coordinate]
Plane should be XY, YZ, or XZ
Out of plane coordinate is the location of the plane (for example [XY, 100] would be the XY plane located at Z = 100)
If "D" is given as the out of plane coordinate, the plane that bisects the microstructure is chosen
If "END" is given as the out of plane coordinate, the largest possible out of plane coordinate is used ([XY, END] gives the top surface)
*****
[XZ, 100]
[XY, END]
[XY, D]
**********
Y/N Options for data analysis of representative regions
If "XY Size (in cells)" is specified, XY cross-section of region will be a specific size, centered in the plane
If "XY Size (in cells)" is set to "D", the cross-section will crop out either 20 cells (for non-multilayer data sets) or as many cells as necessary to get a cross-section at least 20 cells from X and Y substrate boundaries (for multilayer data sets)
Z Size will span domain top to bottom
